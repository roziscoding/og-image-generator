OpenGraph Image Generator for [blog.roz.ninja](https://blog.roz.ninja)
---

This simply receives a piece of text and, optionally, a font size and generates an image to be used with OpenGraph.

## Running

- Clone this
- `cd` into the cloned folder
- Run `deno run -A mod.tsx`

## Params

- `title` (string): Text of the image
- `fontSize` (number): Size of the font to use when rendering the text

## Contributing

It's unlikely that you'll use this as is, so it's unlikely i'll need a PR. If you like it, though, feel free to copy it

## LICENSE

Except for the image and font, everything else is licensed under the MIT license.

I **do not allow** the usage of the `bg_full.png` image for any purposes, and
I **do now own** the rights to the font `font.woff`.
